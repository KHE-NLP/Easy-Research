An AI that creates summaries of academic articles as presentations.

Summary of how the project works:
  - Taking input data of a PDF research paper.
    - our model does not require any input data to train on
  - Create text output, store in database.
  - Python code pulls from database and creates powerpoints
  - Powerpoint can be downloaded from web app
  
  The app will source the paper directly and does not condone submitting the work as ones owm. It should only be used for understanding and sharing
